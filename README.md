# Swift Code Collection

## Introduction
This is a collection of Swift programming projects I have been working on. Most are incomplete or use an older version of the Swift programming language. The majority of these projects are intended to be deployed to an iPad for in-class demonstrations. The original uploads are ZIP files of the projects.

## Updates
As this is a part-time endeavor, the updates to these projects will take some time.
